# Python Week 4 Assignment: File Read & Write + Error Handling

## Overview
This Python program demonstrates how to:
- Read content from a user-specified file
- Modify the content (e.g., convert to uppercase)
- Write the modified content to a new file
- Handle common file-related errors gracefully

Itâ€™s designed to reinforce core concepts in **file handling**, **string manipulation**, and **exception management**.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the name of an existing file.
2. **File Reading**: Attempts to read the file content.
3. **Content Modification**: Transforms the content (currently converts to uppercase).
4. **File Writing**: Saves the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
5. **Error Handling**: Catches and reports issues like missing files or read/write failures.
